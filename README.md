📖 About The Project
Multidisciplinary innovation in healthcare technology requires rapid, structured access to complementary expertise. Currently, these partnerships depend largely on personal networks or coincidence.
+1

The Gap: Engineers developing healthcare technologies require clinical domain knowledge, workflow understanding, and validation processes. Conversely, healthcare professionals often generate strong innovation ideas but lack the engineering competence to implement them.
+1

The HEALTH AI platform eliminates randomness in interdisciplinary collaboration by providing structured announcement-based partner discovery, secure first-contact initiation, and a transparent meeting workflow .

🛑 Core Philosophy

HEALTH AI is fundamentally a user experience platform where usability is the highest priority.
+1

It IS: A secure matchmaking infrastructure, a structured partner announcement board, and a trust-based interdisciplinary bridge.
+1

It is NOT: A document repository, a medical data system, a project management suite, or a file-sharing service .

✨ Key Features
Controlled Registration: Access is strictly restricted to institutional .edu email addresses. Personal email providers are not permitted.
+1

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Distinct workflows for Engineers, Healthcare Professionals, and Admins.

Structured Post Creation: Users can create targeted announcements detailing their working domain, project stage, and required expertise (with configurable confidentiality levels) .

Advanced Search & Matching: Filter posts by domain, required expertise, city, country, and project stage .

Secure Meeting Workflow: Interested parties can send meeting requests that include NDA acceptance.
+1

Comprehensive Audit Trail: Tamper-resistant logging of logins, post creations, meeting requests, and security events with a 24-month retention period .

👥 User Workflows
Engineer-Initiated Flow

Registers with an .edu email and creates a structured post detailing the healthcare expertise needed and the high-level idea .

Healthcare professionals browse posts and express interest via a short message.

The engineer acknowledges interest and suggests meeting times.

The doctor selects a time and sends a "Meeting Request".

If a collaboration forms after their external meeting, the engineer marks the announcement as "Partner Found" (CLOSED) .

Doctor-Initiated Flow

Registers with an .edu email and posts a medical field idea detailing the desired technical expertise .

Engineers browse posts and express interest.

The doctor suggests meeting times, and the engineer sends a "Meeting Request".

If successful, the doctor marks the post as "Partner Found" .

🔒 Security & Constraints
Strictly No Medical/IP Data: The system does NOT allow the upload of technical documentation or patient data to reduce legal and GDPR risks .
+1

First Contact Only: The platform facilitates first contact only; there are no financial transactions or contract management features .

GDPR Compliance: Implements minimal data collection, right to delete/export data, and no patient data storage .

System Security: Mandatory HTTPS, encrypted password storage, automatic session timeouts, and anti-bot protection .
